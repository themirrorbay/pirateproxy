	<p>Does it seem like it's impossible to download your favorite torrents now? No worries, with pretty fast and reliable proxies, you can get back into our community. There are many pirate bay proxy sites, but ours is a clear choice.</p>
	<p>What are website proxies? Well, long story short, it's an automatic process of accessing blocked websites. Some ISP restrictions could have you completely blocked from the website. Thatâ€™s why you need a service from pirate bay proxy sites.</p>
	<p>One way to deal with it is to switch your provider, but good chances are it won't help because it's blocked internally by the government. You can ask a friend to download something for you, but it is certainly inconvenient. You also can drive to another country or simulate it by using a VPN. When it's not possible or available, our pirate bay proxy is the answer you need.</p>
	<p>We are a middleman to access the main tpb site, so we can help find a working URL with our pirate bay proxy.</p>

            <div class="text-justify">
				<p>This project would appear in media with the TPB acronym, The Pirate Bay - an internet freedom project that a group of site developers started from Sweden in 2009 with Peter Sunde as the spokesperson. Even some of the co-founders have been found guilty.</p>
				<p>The idea is pretty simple: let people download what they want to download, whenever they want, absolutely for free. This is why they have grown exponentially!</p>
				<p>It is now a vast platform designed and developed specifically to share knowledge and media between people worldwide and has been for more than ten years. People behind pirate bay got short sentences with thousands of euros in fines. Thatâ€™s why you should protect yourself with a pirate proxy site to get your downloaded favorite files.</p>
				<p>The project looks like a massive database with torrent files of various types: audio, video, software applications, games, movies, tv, etc.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="2">ThePirateBay Makes Finding Torrents Pretty Easy</h2>
			   <p>Before huge pirate bay proxy sites, indexers were a thing, it would be almost impossible to get a well-seeded torrent, but it's not that hard when you have pirate bay proxies with a lot of daily visitors. Just choose the category you need or type the required product name, and you can get it reasonably quickly.</p>
			   <p>If you don't know what you are looking for, use the current Torrents category and find download torrent files of what other people are actively downloading. And most people use pirate proxy sites, like our pirate bay proxies.</p>
			   <p>There are different operating systems that allow torrent indexers:</p>
			   <p>
			   <ul>
			   <li>PC</li>
			   <li>MAC</li>
			   <li>Linux</li>
			   <li>Android</li>
			   <li>UNIX</li>
			   <li>Other OS</li>
			   </ul>
			   </p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="3">How to Download files from TPB</h2>
				<p>If you don't understand how pirate bay torrenting works nowadays, you probably need a guide on doing it.</p>
				<p>The first step is installing any popular pirate bay torrent clients. They work similarly, so choose whatever looks better for your needs. Pick one of those for your copyrighted content downloading:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>UTorrent</li>
				<li>BitTorrent</li>
				<li>Deluge</li>
				<li>Transmission</li>
				<li>BitComet</li>
				<li>BitLord</li>
				<li>Tribler</li>
				<li>FOlx</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Once it is fully installed, go to The Pirate Bay.org domain name. On top of the webpage, you can see the search bar, type the keyword, and hit enter to find the entire single file anonymously you are looking for. Itâ€™s important to use a keyword to find what you need.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, go to the categories page and find it there using the search bar. To start a download, simply click on the Get Torrent magnet link and push the download button or connect button.</p>
				<p>After clicking on the magnet link, the torrent client should recognize it, decrypt it, and then start downloading content or the file you are looking for.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="4">How Do I Know Which Torrent Is The Best?</h2>
				<p>If search results are overwhelming for you to the degree when you don't know which peer to peer file sharing website is the working one and which one is not, here are some tips to avoid malicious content:</p>
				<p>
               <ol>
				<li>Look at the number of Seeders and Leechers on thepiratebay. Seeder is the one who gives out copyrighted content for people, and the leecher is the one who downloads the pirated content from the seeder. We want to find a torrent with a high amount of seeders, but a low amount of leechers, so there are a lot of people willing to send you to share torrent files and a tiny amount to download. That's how you get maximum download speed.</li>
				<li>The more seeders there are on pirate bay, the better and stable the connection will be. That's why one seeder and 0 leechers are wrong, even though there are no people who are going to compete with you and steal your high-speed connection. So the more seeders you have youâ€™ll access speed that will download it faster for you.</li>
				<li>When youâ€™re downloading large torrent files, you typically want to find as many seeders as possible on pirate bay, even if the leechers number is pretty significant. The way torrenting works is you don't download the whole file. Instead, you get pieces and then compile them into one file. So if there are 50 computers worldwide willing to send you information, it's not stressful to lose a bit from someone who stopped seeding because there are many other ones to back you up.</li>
				<li>Watch out for fake torrent files and malicious torrents. Always turn on your Antimalware software and do not turn off Windows Firewall if it gets prompted. If you do, youâ€™ll have a higher chance of getting a virus. You should always check the comments section before downloading pirated content.</li>
               </ol>
				</p>
				<p>When you get many different results for the same file with a lot of different sizes, it's not exactly a bad situation. Usually, it means that the torrent has previous versions of the file and the current one. Or, if we talk about media download files(audio and videos), it simply means those large torrent files are of different parts quality.</p>
				<p>If we talk about 1080p Bluray movies, the size can be like 5GB, but if we talk about 1080p 60FPS, you can see the same film with 60GB+ weight. At the same time, if you want a low-quality movie like 360p WebRip, it can weigh like 500MB.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="5">Ins and Outs</h2>
				<p>When accessing the Pirate Bay Site, you will be able to access almost everything, including the best content that you own. Let's take a look at all-time TPB statistics from the highest number first:</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
				<li>40% of all-time searches on torrent indexers are consist of favorite movies and your favorite tv series queries</li>
				<li>30% is an adult entertainment</li>
				<li>15% books</li>
				<li>10% is audio</li>
				<li>The rest of the copyrighted content is miscellaneous, like comics, games applications, keygen codes, audiobooks, 3D models (physibles), pictures, etc on thepiratebay. Youâ€™ll surely find your favorite content creators or original site content here on pirate bay.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>Everything is inside an extensive database with upload dates, peers, leechers, and names and constantly gets updated in real-time. There is no need to register; you would need an account to upload torrents, that's for sure, but if you are a regular user, it's fine without one.</p>
				<p>On private trackers and websites, it is mandatory to have an account and even pay for registration, but it's completely free in the case of The Pirate Bay mirrors.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="6">The technical side of The Pirate Bay</h2>
				<p>The website had Hypercube webserver as an old and deprecated technology a long time ago. Since then, pirate bay developers upgraded it by making it less hardware-heavy, reducing bandwidth, and making it easier to understand.</p>
				<p>At this time, the server was getting two requests per millisecond on each of four Linux shared intermediate servers, so the team moved to more than 30 different servers to help ease traffic which helped the internet speed.</p>
				<p>The pirate bay website runs eight web parts, one global database, multiple search systems, and numerous BitTorrent files trackers. The frontend is written on PHP using Lighttpd, and the previously mentioned database is MySQL. Search systems are powered with Sphinx, and everything on the website gets cached by Varnish.</p>
				<p>In 2007 backend finally migrated from Hypercube to an open-source solution called Opentracker. Also, SSL encryption was introduced around that time to prevent ISPS (internet service providers) from seeing detailed information about requests and to secure its user base. This migration made it possible to synchronize dozens of servers using UDP multicast.</p>
				<p>IPv6 support was turned off entirely from Opentracker in 2009 since many people at that time were already introduced to decentralized ways of torrenting with things like Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Peer Exchange (PEX).</p>
				<p>At the end of 2012, magnet links were announced as the only way of getting torrent information from the pirate bay website since it would be beneficial for running costs, the reason behind it is additionally storing torrent files would drive server prices higher than it could be with Magnet Link technology.</p>

               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="7">Legal issues and Concerns</h2>
				<p>Of course, there are fears of being prosecuted by the government and copyright companies when it comes to torrenting. Almost every torrent in every category typically would be under copyright protection by either developer or creator, but you shouldn't be afraid of downloading it. Avoid sharing it everywhere you can since it can be interpreted as copyright laws or other legal issues.</p>
				<p>Even if you are file sharing with your friend, you are still free to do it since it is Peer To Peer sharing and it doesn't fall under copyright infringement or legal issues, especially if you created the torrent yourself and have ownership rights to it, BitTorrent client protocol usage does not have legal issues.</p>
				<p>Original pirate bay site developers had many legal implications with copyright companies and copyright laws in court since this activity could be classified as a copyright violation. That's the cost of running such a project including numerous litigations.</p>
				<p>Seeing how successful those court cases are, other countries decided to press providers to block the website because of legal issues. That's why accessing the pirate bay mirrors and tpb proxies is an excellent way to torrent nowadays. And this is another reason to use pirate bay proxy sites.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="8">How To Access The Pirate Bay From Mobile?</h2>
               <img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" alt="How to Access The Pirate Bay from Mobile" title="Access Pirate Bay from mobile" src="/images/website/3.webp" data-lazy-type="image" data-original="/images/website/3.webp"/>
               <noscript><img class="img-responsive" alt="piratebay org" title="Access Pirate Bay from mobile" src="/images/website/3.webp"/></noscript>
				<p>If you've accessed the website from your phone before 2015, you probably closed the page right away since it had a horrible mobile experience. Pages would be a mess, different categories would return no results, and even when they do, it would be unresponsive.</p>
				<p>Since those times, it changed to a good side. Now when you access pirate bay it's fully responsive not only on mobile but on tablets too. To grow its mobile visitors base were introduced a few mobile categories like iOS users, Android users, and blackberry users.</p>
				<p>To this day, you still can't download torrents on iOS without jailbreaking, but when it comes to Android, you can download any mobile torrent client and go with it. You can get it from the App Store or Google Play store. The experience is the same as on PC.</p>
				<p>Besides Mobile support, there is also an RSSBay tool that utilizes RSS technology to make it possible to control your downloads on PC from Mobile.</p>
				<p>No matter what platform you are on and where you live, it's an infinite source of new content, with more than 2000 individual files being added each day from individual users.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="9">Download Anonymously</h2>
				<p>If anonymity is your highest priority, use either I2P or Tor Project. It hides your digital fingerprint and, on top of that, changes your IP address so you won't expose your personal information. There are different ways to do it, but these two are completely safe ways. We recommend hiding your address by using one of the services listed below.</p>
				<p>The way TOR works could be described the following way:</p>
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>You connect to a random node</li>
				<li>That node connects to other nodes</li>
				<li>The exit node is now doing what you would do on your PC</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>The way I2P works is the same, but all requests are one way from node to node, so it gets more complicated than TOR, but the user base is smaller, so it should work faster for you. Both are equally effective.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="10">Sending Donations To Support The Pirate Bay</h2>
               <img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" alt="Sending Donations to Support The Pirate Bay" title="Piratebay donations" src="/images/website/4.webp" data-lazy-type="image" data-original="/images/website/4.webp"/>
               <noscript><img class="img-responsive" alt="pirate bay" title="Piratebay donations" src="/images/website/4.webp"/></noscript>
               <p>For two years, between 2004 and 2006, The Pirate Bay provided a link on its home page through which donors could access its donations page. On this page, it offered various payment methods for donors to use and clearly stated that each one's donations were used for supporting the tracker. It also offered several time-limited benefits, including no ads and VIP (very important person) status for donors.</p>
               <p>But the link was later removed and donors requested to send donations to their local pro-piracy groups, who later redirected the cash to the pirate bayâ€™s main page. In 2009, an ad reported that TPB was appealing for donations to assist it remains operational.</p>
			   <p>In 2006, the location had received 35,000 SEK, the same of US$4,925.83, from Petter Nilsson, an official who appeared on Toppkandidaterna, a well-liked political reality television program. TPB used the donation to get more servers.</p>
			   <p>The website also ran a fundraising campaign in 2007 with the aim of acquiring Sealand, which was said to possess a micronation status at the time. In 2009, TPB founders refused to require donations from their supporters to pay fines. The location started using bitcoin and litecoin addresses to receive donations in 2013.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="11">Pirate Bay Policy Violation Fee</h2>
               <p>Developers feature a usage policy that allows them to get $5,000 from companies that violate this policy quickly. For example, in 2017 a book publisher in Sweden decided to scrap the website for books with different packet files associated with copyright but was fined for violating the policy.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="12">Pirate Bay purchases</h2>
				<p>The ACFI attempted to get a new micronation in Sealand for Pirate Bay when it was placed on the market. Still, the government was not ready to partner with somebody they thought were thieves and violated copyright issues to download illegal content. When it failed, they tried to get a whole island for more than â‚¬14,000 that they raised using the donations system, but it didn't work out either.</p>
				<p>In 2007 TorrentFreak announced that developers got an online domain previously owned by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. They stand on the anti-piracy ground, and the whole process of pro-piracy groups acquiring huge anti-piracy parts was rather funny.</p>
				<p>Later it became clear that someone hacked the original pirate bay website domain name and transferred it to the team, and the transfer was reverted by court order.</p>

               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="13">Thepiratebay.org Blocked in Many Countries</h2>
				<p>In 2021 many countries restricted access or blocked the original domain on a national level across all internal network providers, including the United Kingdom, Turkey, Sweden, Spain, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Romania, Portugal, Netherlands, Malaysia, Italy, Ireland, India, Germany, France, China, Belgium, Austria, and Australia.</p>
				<p>Judging by the long pirate proxy server list, it is understandable why the pirate bay mirrors and our pirate bay proxy server sites and mirrors are so popular nowadays and so important to use. So if it is blocked in your country there is a solution. Additionally, some internet providers will provide your data to the authorities with a pirate bay warning.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="14">The Pirate Bay Disadvantages and Advantages </h2>
               <img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" alt="The Pirate Bay Advantages and Disadvantages" title="Piratebay: pros-cons" src="/images/website/5.webp" data-lazy-type="image" data-original="/images/website/5.webp"/>
               <noscript><img class="img-responsive" alt="thepiratebay" title="Piratebay: pros-cons" src="/images/website/5.webp"/></noscript>
               <h3>Advantages:</h3>
			   <p>
			   <ol>
			   <li><h4>Easy To Find What You Need</h4>
			   <p>There are names, categories, upload dates, seeders indicators, and the total size of the whole torrent in one place with automating sorting. You can get whatever you want, knowing only one keyword or part of the torrent name. Also, there is a description and comment section under the torrent page, making it even easier to understand what you are dealing with.</p>
			   </li>
			   <li><h4>The Fastest Download Speed on the Internet</h4>
			   <p>The website is so big that even unpopular torrents have some seeders at any given moment. When talking about popular ones, there are hundreds of peers connected to them, so there is almost no downtime, and the speed is at maximum. Trackers included in torrents are heavily moderated, so when one comes down, it changes to another, and the network keeps working.</p>
			   </li>
			   <li><h4>Accessibility</h4>
			   <p>The fact that an international blockade with a bunch of governments couldn't kill the website for more than a decade shows how strong the project currently is. A vast portion of this support comes from people who run the pirate bay mirrors and pirate proxy service.</p>
			   </li>
			   <li><h4>Being Included in a Community</h4>
			   <p>When you are torrenting through the pirate bay proxies website, you are welcomed in the community because you support a P2P(peer-to-peer sharing) file-sharing network that uses the honor code. The unwritten code is to wait sometime after you finish downloading other files you need so that other people could download some file pieces from you. You can meet a lot of cool people with different backgrounds on the pirate forum too. Additionally, you should leave positive comments if the download content was as expected in the comments section.</p>
			   </li>
			   <li><h4>Completely Free</h4>
			   <p>There is no paid registration, membership fee, no paid downloads, and uploads. You are free to download/upload content whatever, whenever. Just remember, that includes possible malicious content too.</p>
			   </li>
			   <li><h4>Interruptions Doesn't Matter</h4>
			   <p>If there is an interruption of some sort during the download, it won't matter. You can pause, disconnect, or even cancel your download, and it will recognize and start from the point of interruption when you resume it back. That's made by checking file hashes and is 100% reliable.</p>
			   </li>
			   <li><h4>Impossible To Completely Remove The Website</h4>
			   <p>Whenever the main domain is getting blocked in someone's country - people already know what to do. They go on google and type something like "piratebayproxylist" or "the pirate bay proxylist," and here you go with ten more working domains. How do you stop THIS kind of rebellion against censorship? In most cases, people will always find ways around and continue enjoying their torrents.</p>
               </li>
			   </ol>
			   </p>
			   <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
			   <p>
			   <ol>
			   <li><h4>Keep an eye on Sensitive Content</h4></li>
			   <p>Itâ€™s a good thing the pirate bay moderators do a pretty good job, but it is entirely a volunteer job, so you can't expect a lot from them. Sometimes people upload questionable things and hide them behind encryption. That's why you shouldn't go out of your way and instead stick to popular torrents at the top of your search results. It wouldn't be in the top-5 results if it were terribleâ€”most of the time.</p>
			   <li><h4>Malicious Torrents</h4></li>
			   <p>There is a significant disadvantage when you use torrents - harmful malware. It would be best if you always were very careful with what you download, so it is at your own risk. If it is a video or audio file, you are probably fine because there is no way of infecting it, at least not in today's world where all exploits for those extensions are already fixed in one way or another. But when it comes to games applications and software cracks on The Pirate Bay, there is some serious risk, so always keep your reliable antivirus program up to date and never turn off your firewall if requested by any popular new torrent websites. Again, downloading torrents can be risky, so do it at your own risk.</p>
			   <li><h4>IP Address Exposal</h4></li>
			   <p>When you download torrents, you communicate with trackers, special servers designed to store and send information about peers. When you download from The Pirate Bay, you ask the server about people willing to send you multiple files, and the other way around when you upload to the webserver. It is your communication center. It means anyone can send a request and ask a tracker willing to share the file, and when you say yes, you are exposing yourself. That's why you usually would want to purchase or download and use a reliable VPN (a virtual private network) specifically for the pirate bay.</p>
			   <li><h4>Impossible to check the Files Before Downloading torrents</h4></li>
			   <p>Sometimes people like to troll or interfere with p2p(peer-to-peer) file-sharing by downloading torrent trash that doesn't even work. It happens unintentionally, too, though, so you need to keep trying. There is no workaround for it. Sometimes youâ€™ll even get free content without sound too, and that happens even on sought-after torrent sites.</p>
			   </ol>
			   </p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="15">How to be an Uploader on pirate bays:</h2>
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Open the website</li>
				<li>Log into your account or register a new one</li>
				<li>Find an Upload button</li>
				<li>It will open your file explorer, select downloaded torrent file</li>
				<li>Type a name, choose a category and add some keywords</li>
				<li>Press Upload</li>
				<li>Start seeding, and don't stop until it has enough active seeders, or people won't be able to fully access it.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>Uploading content is simple, but you need an active account to do so. Many accounts got banned over the past year since criminals are actively trying to take advantage of a search engine by uploading false information or malicious files.</p>
				<p>Also, you cannot register a new account right now since it was disabled a few years ago after the website got an influx of fake torrents. Either wait some time, or you need to find a valid account from somewhere.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="16">The Pirate Bay Doesn't Hide Your Identity</h2>
				<p>You are entitled to your anonymity, use tools to hide from the government and copyright companies. Most of the torrent sites donâ€™t hide your identity either. Thatâ€™s one of the main reasons to use a pirate proxy. The IP address should be your main priority.</p>
				<p>It can be done using TOR, but it won't protect you during downloading from trackers, so we recommend that you use a VPN(a virtual private network) to cover the whole system at once without leaving a trace anywhere.</p>
				<p>Other torrenting sites are just as dangerous, so you might be good with pretty much any virtual private network (VPN). The main problem with downloading torrent files on The Pirate Bay from your internet provider is your internet service providers (commonly referred to as ISP) forwarding messages from copyright companies to your email, which will try to sue you after numerous violations get recorded.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="17">Download Torrents from Pirate bays Using VPNs</h2>
               <img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" alt="Download Torrents from Piratebay Using VPNs" title="Use VPN to download from pirate bay" src="/images/website/1.webp" data-lazy-type="image" data-original="/images/website/1.webp"/>
               <noscript><img class="img-responsive" alt="the pirates bay" title="Use VPN to download from pirate bay" src="/images/website/1.webp"/></noscript>
			   <p>There are many free VPNs services fashionable among people using a torrent website since they permit them to download torrent files safely without exposing their IP addresses. They also enable internet users to access websites that are blocked in many different countries. It's also hard for authorities to trace your activities on the web once you have them. It helps you use the web and pirate bay anonymously.</p>
			   <p>This technology encrypts your internet connection and replaces your IP address with another. It is prevalent in countries where censorship is exceptionally high, and surveillance privacy laws infringe on people's privacy, like in China, America, Australia, and the UK. Some applications are free, but some require you to pay a small fee.</p>
			   <p>When you choose the right VPN for downloading torrent files from TPB, you would like to try to research the companies available and their services. If you don't find any VPN that suits your needs, you can make your own with OpenVPN.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="18">Best Pirate Bay Alternatives</h2>
			   <ul>
			   <li>1337x
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">This one is the best pirate bay alternatives in terms of outsmarting media companies. It has many domains, which gets seized quite frequently, but it still works like nothing is happeningâ€”a great source of music videos, audio-video applications, games, movies, a TV Show, or TV series for a pirate bay alternative.</span>
				</li>
			   <li>KickassTorrents
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">The United States and United kingdom governments took down the king of torrenting in the middle of 2016. It still has its community to this day which tries to save it from instinct.</span>
				</li>
			   <li>YTS aka YIFY
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">Only verified torrents on The Pirate Bay are made by an organized group that specifies releasing high res movies in the best quality possible. It had some local battles with the Movie Association of America in 2014-2016, which led to domain seizures and the rise of copycats. Unlike any other verified torrent website, every torrent is highly documented in descriptions, which usually has a less informative description section.
				</li>
				</span>
			   <li>Zoogle
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">It came from Russia and had more than 5 million unique torrents for these pirate bay alternatives, was localized for English-speaking users, and now has a pretty good user base despite being some of the newest torrent websites on the internet.</span>
				</li>
			   <li>TorLock
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">Even more popular than Zoogle with many cool features like online activities, or chats with torrent and privacy discussions, an instant catalog of more than 7.5 million torrent hashes, and sorting by category, name, and size. So again, we highly recommend that you use a VPN like most torrent users for any pirate bay alternatives.</span>
				</li>
			   </ul>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="19">Why Should We Use Proxies and Mirrors?</h2>
			   <p>Numerous countries and governments globally ban the project and other third parties. Still, pirate bay mirror sites are getting better and more prominent, being on bulletproof hostings and jurisdictions that are liable to copyright problems as a whole.</p>
			   <p>This way, it is possible to still use the proxy site despite 10+ years of seizures, court cases, fines, and bans. There are many pirate bay proxy list sites, but most canâ€™t be trusted.</p>
			   <p>The best way to unblock The Pirate Bay is through so-called mirrors, which allows you to open a proxy site from the country which didn't block it yet. So if the pirate bay is blocked, the mirror operator will move it to another country without any problem.</p>
			   <p>Also, you can always try to do it with VPN or TOR by rolling the dice repeatedly until you get an IP address from the Network Provider, which allows a request to the pirate bay. So, long story short, use the pirate bay proxy sites and a mirror site to protect yourself.</p>
               <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="20">How Is It Still Operational After All These Years?</h2>
               <img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" alt="Top Five Alternatives to Pirate Bay" title="Pirate bay alternatives" src="/images/website/2.webp" data-lazy-type="image" data-original="/images/website/2.webp"/>
               <noscript><img class="img-responsive" alt="the pirate bay" title="Pirate bay alternatives" src="/images/website/2.webp"/></noscript>
			   <p>Long story short, through donations and loyal fans. The team accepts donations through Monero, Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Litecoin cryptocurrency to cover the server cost. This is how the proxy site makes money.</p>
			   <p>At the same time, the community is moderating the torrent site and forums voluntarily while developers are trying to hold a middle ground between copyright infringement and freedom of speech.</p>
			   <p>And most people use pirate bay proxy sites for privacy. On top of that, they are still doing ongoing technological advancements to keep the pirate bay site running to the best of their ability for other users.</p>
			   <h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="21">What Is the Quality of Movies Found On Pirate bay?</h2>
			   <p>Usually, it is barely possible to know the quality beforehand. You can see the uploader claiming it's 1080p ripped from Bluray, but in reality, it is scarcely 480p WebRip. The best way to know for sure is to download yourself and judge by your own experience or try to use google chrome to see some comments made about it. If you see the colors green, or pink means trusted providers.</p>
			   <p>Additionally, green means they are VIPs. And green means VIP users, so you can trust their uploads. So remember, pirate bay is just a host, so they do not determine the quality of torrent files uploaded.</p>
				<h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="22">Define the 'Pirates'</h2>
				<p>Pirates are the people who use torrent trackers, including those not registered on any torrent downloaders. Since its creation, it has had more than 6 million registered users and many VIP users, thus pirates. Hopefully, the user base will continue growing, and the peer-to-peer network remains resilient.</p>
				<p>So when youâ€™re using pirate bay, use the pirate bay proxies listed here! So in conclusion, there are many pirate bay proxy sites, but ours is the best for the price.</p>
				<h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="23">How much does it cost to use The Pirate Bay?</h2>
				<p>The answer is NO! Pirate Bay is free for everyone since it wouldn't be ethical to take money for using copyrighted materials and the whole point behind the project is to make sharing files and materials as popular as possible which cannot be made if it would require paying money.</p>
				<p>The only way of fighting big greedy companies which want to make as much money out of you as possible is to make exactly the opposite, which is to make accessible paid material for everybody.</p>
				<p>However, when we talk about Pirate Bay being free there is a misconception about the developers of The Pirate Bay not being able and not making any money whatsoever which is wrong since there are ads on the website. One of the few methods to make money with websites is paid banner rotation which you can see while browsing pirate bay directories and categories.</p>
				<p>Also, if you're a cryptocurrency fan, you can support the people behind the website using for example Litecoin or Bitcoin. That's how The Pirate Bay developers are funding their project right now since it is under the constant pressure of politicians and private companies around the world.</p>
				<h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="24">How to create a torrent for Pirate Bay?</h2>
				<p>First of all, let's talk about what is the torrent file and how do you make one yourself. A torrent file is a file with the .torrent extension, which contains important information about the directory you are trying to share with other people. Typically you would find file names, hashes, sizes inside it.</p>
				<p>There are two methods of creating the torrent:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Manual
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">Through programming libraries like py3createtorrent, which can help you to automate the whole process if you are into uploading massive amounts of torrents. There are different kinds of arguments, also you can use custom comments for your torrent, I'd recommend putting "The Pirate Bay" as a comment to show respect for the oldest and biggest anti-copyright website ever created.</span>
				</li>
				<li>Semi-Automatic
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">Using popular clients like Utorrent, BitTorrent, Deluge, etc. Usually, you would just click on "create torrent", then choose a directory, put a few parameters like comment, name, etc. and you're ready!</span>
				</li>
				</ol>
				<p>There are also two methods of sharing your torrent file:</p>
				<ol>
				<li>.Torrent
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">Through the .torrent file, this is how and what you will be uploading to Pirate Bay. It usually weighs around 2-3 KB, but don't worry, everything is alright since it will be coordinated through the tracker, your files are not actually inside it. They never are.</span>
				</li>
				<li>Magnet
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">Through "Magnet Link". This is an alternative to the .torrent file, it is just a text with arguments and parameters just like in the first method. Pirate Bay supports this method too.</span>
				</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You're probably asking yourself, what is the "tracker"? Well, this is what will kind of decrypt your .torrent or magnet link and find a computer on the Internet which will share the file with you.</p>
				<p>The Pirate Bay will replace trackers inside the file you upload with the working ones so it will be valid and working at any moment. Also, it cannot be spoofed or replaced maliciously since the Torrent client won't allow it to go through by looking at the information hash.</p>
				<h2 style="background:#fff;border-bottom:none;" class="text-center" id="25">What are those different Icons on The Pirate Bay mean?</h2>
				<p>There is no way you never saw unusual types of user profiles on the pirate bay. Sometimes, people think that if there is a skull on a user profile - it means something bad might happen to you if you will try to use this share, it's like admins are trying to say to you "this download is bad", but it is quite the opposite. If you discover an unusual image right after the username - it means the user is honored in the pirate bay community.</p>
				<p>They are like pirates in a Pirate Bay (pun intended), to each of their kind - different images for a different identity. This is pure symbolism as it usually does not give them any additional rights, services, or premium shares.</p>
				<p>There are three reasons why those different symbols were introduced:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">To pay respects to some members of a community who were helping to grow the pirate bay for a very long time.</span>
				</li>
				<li>
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">To differentiate between staff members (admins, moderators, and such) and regular users.</span>				
				</li>
				<li>
				<span style="display:block;margin-bottom:15px;">To help fight malicious uploads.</span>				
				</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Let's figure out each symbol, why it was given, to whom, and how many users are there with this kind of identity.</p>
				<p>First, let's start with people who were helping to grow the pirate bay. These are called "Helpers". You can ask a question to them on a forum and they might help you directly or forward it to someone higher like an admin or a moderator. You will see them marked as blue. This is impossible to get nowadays and there are only 50 members of the pirate bay with this status.</p>
				<p>The next one is "Trusted" members, those are with "Pink Skull". It means that the user was verified and marked as a consistent uploader of spam-free and malware-free shares. It is higher than blue skill but lower than the next one. There are 30 people with "Trusted" profiles.</p>
				<img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" src="/images/trusted.png" data-lazy-type="image"/>
				<p>And it is the "Green Skull" which translates as "VIP" member of the pirate bay community. It is the highest-profile status you can receive as a regular user and not a member of staff. The most honorable symbol on the whole website. These are super sharers, they upload not only official files but their original content also or the content which you cannot find on other platforms and websites. There is an unknown amount of so-called VIPs, but there is a handful of them.</p>
				<img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" src="/images/vip.png" data-lazy-type="image"/>
				<p>There is also a "Moderator" tag which is used to mark staff members of the 1-st level, there are currently 3 Pirate Bay moderators: "bigdave", "Q91", "Vox". These are essential people for the crew. Without them, Pirate Bay won't be able to exist in the form you can see and use today. Moderators are volunteers, they do not get paid despite spending a considerable amount of their own free time.</p>
				<img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" src="/images/moderator.png" data-lazy-type="image"/>
				<p>On a higher level of The Pirate Bay staff, there are currently 3 "Supermods": "Kingfish", "stormium", "workerbee". These default moderators, but have more rights on the forum.</p>
				<img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" src="/images/supermod.png" data-lazy-type="image"/>
				<p>And the last symbol you can find is "Administrator". The most precious people for the project. These are the current owners, they get money from ads and they spend them on servers and infrastructure. Also, when something goes wrong - these are people who back everything up and restore the website up in case it goes down.</p>
				<img decoding="async"  class="lazyload img-responsive" src="/images/administrator.png" data-lazy-type="image"/>
				<p>Regular users do not have any icon whatsoever, but hey at least they got an account. Quick reminder: you cannot make one since 2015.</p>
				<h2 id="26">Review and Leave Feedback for Your Downloads</h2>
				<P>Itâ€™s a good idea to leave a review and feedback for as many of the downloads you grab off of The Pirate Bay as possible.</p>
				<P>Think of this like a public service. There are probably plenty of other people just like you, finding content on The Pirate Bay that they are interested in, but uncertain of whether or not that content is legitimate or safe to download.</p>
				<P>If you leave a review (positive, negative, or otherwise) youâ€™ll be able to better inform other people that want to download the content you have downloaded, helping to keep people safe and helping to add a lot of extra value to The Pirate Bay community at large.</p>
